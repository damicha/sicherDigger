next:
- add license info to file headers
- file templates
- add level handling: SDig_LevelEngine()
  - init level
  - run level
  - exit level
  - set game info (point, lives, level results)


  0.1pre - text output
========================

* == TODOs ==

* add the main page for doxygen documentation

* physicsEngine.h, physicsEngine.cpp: game physic engine
  - add physics engine for obj types, empty, sand, wall, diamond

* common:
 - use github to store the sources

* == history ==

* SDig_GameEngine:
  - creates TextEngine, TimeEngine and PhysicsEngine
  - creates object field (game data)
  - controls data and engines

* SDig_TextEngine.h: text output/input engine
  - ncurses is used
  - basic drawing of the object field
  - maps data object type to an specified character

* SDig_TimeEngine.h/.cpp: waits for a configurable trigger event
  - uses the system functions gettimeofday() and usleep()

* SDig_PhysicsEngine.h/.cpp: game physic engine
  - simple stone movement (it's falling down) was added
  - player physics to move to the left, right, up and down

* baseDataObjectType.h, baseDataObjectType.cpp
  - The base data object type class baseDataObjectType for derived data object
    types (stone, wall, sand, ...)
  - function to create a object of a derived baseDataObjectType class as a function
    of the required object type.

* dataObjectTypes.h
  - The data object type classes dotWall, dotSand, dotStone and dotEmpty derived
    from class baseDataObjectType.

* dataObject.h, dataObject.cpp
  - data object class that contains the type of the object and some members that
    defines the state of class' instance.

* objField.h, objField.cpp:
  - creates and initializes an object field from a configuration array

* objFieldEntry.h, objFieldEntry.cpp:
  - ...

* config.h: field configuration class
  - a simple char array is used to set the default values of an objField

* configData.h: field configurations
