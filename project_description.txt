INTRODUCTION

The project sicherDigger is a variant of the game BoulderDash that was very
popular in the mid 80's. It's programmed in C++ and currently runnable in a
shell. It's planned to implement a physic engine with simple rules to control
the level elements like rocks and monsters and it's planned to implement a SDL
gfx engine. The sources are managed by a git repository that is accessible on
GitHub.
